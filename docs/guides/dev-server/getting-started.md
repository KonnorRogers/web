Back in the early web development days there was no need for any server.
As a Web Developer you wrote HTML and you opened that code in your browser and it just worked.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form>
      <label>
        E-Mail:
        <input type="text" />
      </label>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```
